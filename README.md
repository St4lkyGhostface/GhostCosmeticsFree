This tool's source code was meant to release soon, but since some "leakers", "leaking" a tool available for free on various places 
decided to do the only thing they know how to do, I decided to rush this.
And since they used some cheap skid TheMida unpacker and most likely de4dot removing the commentaries, they broke quite some parts of the code.
Everyone makes mistakes and so there's people like me to fix their mess of "leak".

Enjoy and try not to sell this for 40 euros like one of the leakers did with a pasted code.


Made with <3 as always.
